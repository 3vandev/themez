# Themez
THEMEZ is a themes manager for neofetch and can also be modified to run for other programs

### Plans
My plan is to allow the user to install themes directly from the internet quickly and easily

### Installation
Open a terminal window and type the command
`git clone https://github.com/3vandev/themez'

Once the repository is cloned cd into as follows
`cd themez`

Now make sure python3 is install on your computer if not install it with your systems package manager
`pacman -S python3` Arch based distros
`apt install python3` debian based distro
`dnf install python3` Fedora and other redhat based distros

if you are not root make sure you run the command with sudo

Now that python is installed run the installer with:
`python installer.py` or
`python3 installer.py`

once the installer finshies restart your terminal and run themez to test
